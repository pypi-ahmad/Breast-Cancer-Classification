**A Medical-Grade AI Command Center for Tumor Classification.**

## Project Overview

**Mission:** Build a clinician-friendly diagnostic assistant that classifies breast tumors as **Malignant vs. Benign**, prioritizing **high sensitivity (Recall)** to minimize **false negatives**.

**Approach:** Train an ensemble of **5 machine learning models**—**SVM**, **XGBoost**, **Random Forest**, **KNN**, and **Logistic Regression**—then use **Explainable AI (SHAP)** to reveal *why* a specific case was flagged as malignant, improving transparency and trust.

## Key Features

- **🧠 Explainable AI (XAI)**: SHAP waterfall plots explaining *why* a specific patient was diagnosed as Malignant.
- **🎛️ Sensitivity Tuner**: Real-time decision threshold adjustment for medical safety.
- **🗳️ Multi-Model Consensus**: Voting system combining 5 algorithms for robust predictions.
- **🔬 Deep EDA**: PCA Manifold visualization and Feature Correlation heatmaps.
- **🐳 Containerized**: Fully Dockerized for "Write Once, Run Anywhere" deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.11, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost.
- **Dashboard**: Streamlit, Plotly (Interactive Charts), Matplotlib (SHAP).
- **DevOps**: Docker.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Training

Train the full model suite and export the bundle:

```bash
python train.py
```

This generates `models_bundle.pkl` (plus a small `sample_data.csv`).

### Step 3: Launch

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:8501`.

### Step 4: Docker

Build:

```bash
docker build -t oncoguard .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 oncoguard
```

## Model Performance

This system prioritizes **Recall (Sensitivity)**—catching as many malignant cases as possible—over raw accuracy.
In a medical screening context, missing a cancer case (false negative) is typically more costly than a false alarm.
